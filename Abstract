The Screen Time Analysis project is designed to help users monitor and analyze their device usage habits. By tracking daily, weekly, and monthly screen time, this tool provides users with insights into their digital behavior, identifying patterns of overuse or excessive app engagement. The goal of the project is to promote healthier screen habits by enabling users to visualize their screen time data and take actionable steps towards better productivity and digital well-being. The analysis leverages Python libraries for data collection, processing, and visualization, making it an efficient solution for understanding and managing screen time effectively.
